<div align="center"> # Welcome to my personal portfolio!

My name is Alex Anderson and I am a Junior at Penn State majoring in Software Engineering.
I love to play videogames and develop them.
My dream job is to work in the game industry as a game designer.</div>

There is a seperate page for my résumé.</div>

<div align="center">This was a 3D model of a fence that I created for a virtual reality research internship for Penn State during the 2020 summer. I think it was an enjoyable experience to create 3D models from scratch to add to a working virtual reality game.</div>

<div align="center">This was the final assignment in ART 168. The assignment was to 3D model a room and to have a completely rendered photo of your room. I thought that this project brought to light some of the more important aspects of creating an environment.
