On this main page I will provide some digital projects I have worked on.

This was a 3D model of a fence that I created for a virtual reality research internship for Penn State during the 2020 summer. I think it was an enjoyable experience to create 3D models from scratch to add to a working virtual reality game.

This was a photoshop assignment for ART 168 in my third semester of being at Penn State Behrend.

This was the final assignment in ART 168. The assignment was to 3D model a room and to have a completely rendered photo of your room. I thought that this project brought to light some of the more important aspects of creating an environment.
