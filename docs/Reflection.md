# My Reflection Between Developing Websites on WordPress Versus GitHub

GitHub had a higher learning curve in terms of trying to figure out new stuff. You had to look up some stuff on the internet to understand something that you did not know before. 
WordPress was more of an issue of user interface and trying to learn that. Once you learn the user interface you can do some interesting things with the website. 
GitHub had the advantage of being simple to understand regarding the user interface so once you learn the coding it would be fast to create a website. 
I assume it would also be more customizable once you know more about the language in general. 
WordPress has the advantage of not needing to look anything up and just finding it on the site. 
You do not need to remember any code. It was also easier and faster to create a simple but organized website. 
GitHub starts with you needing to have some knowledge of the code while WordPress is easy to use without having to learn anything. 
I would need to learn more of the coding language for GitHub to create better websites, but I would improve on WordPress by just exploring the website a bit more.
